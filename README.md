Hello! Welcome to this project 🦖

It's made for my Computational Thinking Course, which I attended in Year 1 of RGS. Drop me a PM if anything's up!

- My game is based on the original version of Cherry Pickr. Instead of the original Cherry Pickr game, I added a new enemy, and food.
The enemy sprite will follow the player sprite throughout the game. Once the enemy sprite overlaps the player sprite, the game ends and the player loses.
- There is also an “Enemy” which disguises itself as food. Once touched, the game will end.
- There is also a “Point Adder” sprite which once the sprite overlaps, instead of adding one point as usual, the sprite earns two.
- There is also a “Point Deductor” sprite which once the sprite overlaps, the player sprite will lose a point and reset to the middle of the map. 

Have fun playing! 😁
